Introduction 

This is the first Website assignment for my course. 

Creating this website is an opportunity to showcase what I've learnt so far within this course. I will be able to focus on:
        1) What went well? Key Learning
            - Appreciate how accessible it is to practice coding, coding everyday. Coming from an industry that you may not be exposed to skills all the time. Normally on laptop, find that I can fit some quick practice in. 
        2) What could have been improved? 
            - Personal improvement, difficulties in falling behind. Unable to participate during sessions due to not knowing specific questions to ask. 
        3) The key take aways
            - Important to code everyday 
            - Emphasis on how important selectors are
        4) The process you followed? 
            - So much freedom in the assignment, hard to know where to start. Looked for inspiration in other personal websites. 
            - Referencing previous completed labs, comparing why ideas worked in this lab and not the one I'm currently working on, e.g. Column-width vs. width 
            - Using HTML and CSS Validators, assisting in why the code may not be working
